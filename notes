.forEach vs .map

.map is faster in general and returns an object inherently - it gives a new array
.forEach returns undefined - exicutes a call back dies not atomatically return an array
.forEach may be better wants to do something with the data but do not want a new array
        if dont know, use .map 

.filter select certian items of an array - it returns an array with a subset of the array
